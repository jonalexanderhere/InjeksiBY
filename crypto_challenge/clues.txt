=== CLUE 2: The Encoding Method ===
Controller was known for his love of simple encoding methods.
He often used Base64 for his secret communications.

=== CLUE 3: The Character Substitution ===
Controller had a habit of replacing certain characters.
Look for the pattern where 'S' becomes 'P' in his messages.

=== CLUE 4: The Flag Format ===
Controller always used the format PHXCTF{...} for his flags.
This was his signature style.

=== CLUE 5: The Decoding Process ===
1. Decode the Base64 message
2. Look for character substitutions
3. Find the hidden flag

=== CLUE 6: The Final Step ===
After decoding, you'll find: SHXCTF{L0st_Controller}

The mystery deepens...

Good luck, detective!
