PHXCTF Crypto Challenge - Hints

=== HINT 1: Base64 is the main encoding ===
The data is Base64 encoded. Use a Base64 decoder to get the first result.

=== HINT 2: Character substitution ===
After Base64 decoding, you'll get: SHXCTF{K0ol_B4se64_Pols}
Notice that it starts with 'S' instead of 'P'.

=== HINT 3: The substitution rule ===
Replace 'S' with 'P' to get the correct flag format.
S â†’ P

=== HINT 4: Final flag ===
After the substitution, you'll get: PHXCTF{K0ol_B4se64_Pols}

=== HINT 5: Tools to use ===
- Online Base64 decoder
- Python: base64.b64decode()
- Command line: base64 -d

=== HINT 6: Step by step ===
1. Take the encrypted data: U0hYQ1RGe0swb2xfQjRzZTY0X1BvbHN9
2. Decode with Base64: SHXCTF{K0ol_B4se64_Pols}
3. Replace S with P: PHXCTF{K0ol_B4se64_Pols}
4. Submit the flag!

Good luck, crypto master!
