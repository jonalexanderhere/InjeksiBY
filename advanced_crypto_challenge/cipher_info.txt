PHXCTF Advanced Crypto Challenge - Cipher Information

=== CAESAR CIPHER ===
A substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by a fixed number.
Example: A -> D (shift of 3)
Decryption: Shift each letter back by the same amount.

=== VIGENÈRE CIPHER ===
A polyalphabetic substitution cipher using a keyword.
Each letter is shifted by a different amount based on the keyword.
Key: The keyword used for encryption
Decryption: Apply the reverse shift using the same keyword.

=== RAIL FENCE CIPHER ===
A transposition cipher that writes the message in a zigzag pattern.
The message is read row by row.
Key: Number of rails (rows) used
Decryption: Reconstruct the original zigzag pattern.

=== BASE64 ENCODING ===
A binary-to-text encoding scheme using 64 characters.
Characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /
Padding: = (if needed)
Decryption: Use Base64 decoder.

=== XOR OPERATIONS ===
Exclusive OR operation between data and a key.
XOR is reversible: A XOR B XOR B = A
Key: The value used for XOR operation
Decryption: Apply XOR with the same key.

=== MATHEMATICAL TRANSFORMATIONS ===
Operations like modulo, arithmetic shifts, rotations.
Modulo: Remainder after division
Shifts: Moving bits left or right
Rotations: Circular bit shifts

=== FREQUENCY ANALYSIS ===
Analyze the frequency of characters to break ciphers.
Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R
Use this to identify Caesar cipher shifts.

=== PATTERN RECOGNITION ===
Look for repeating patterns in the encrypted data.
Rail Fence: Look for zigzag patterns
Vigenère: Look for repeating key patterns
Caesar: Look for shifted alphabet patterns

Good luck with the decryption!
