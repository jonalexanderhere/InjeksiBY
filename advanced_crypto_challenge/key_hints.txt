PHXCTF Advanced Crypto Challenge - Key Hints

=== HINT 1: Base64 Layer ===
The outermost layer is Base64 encoded.
Look for the characteristic Base64 character set: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /

=== HINT 2: Rail Fence Cipher ===
After Base64 decoding, the data is encoded with Rail Fence cipher.
The number of rails is between 2 and 7.
Try different rail counts to find the correct one.

=== HINT 3: Vigenère Cipher ===
The Vigenère cipher uses a keyword.
Common keywords to try: KEY, PASSWORD, SECRET, CRYPTO, FLAG
The key length affects the decryption pattern.

=== HINT 4: Caesar Cipher ===
The innermost layer uses Caesar cipher.
Try rotation values from 1 to 25.
Look for the pattern "PHXCTF" in the decoded text.

=== HINT 5: Mathematical Operations ===
Some layers might use mathematical transformations.
Look for modulo operations and arithmetic shifts.

=== HINT 6: XOR Operations ===
XOR operations might be applied between layers.
The XOR key could be derived from the previous layer.

=== HINT 7: Steganography ===
Hidden information might be embedded in the data.
Look for patterns that don't belong to normal text.

=== BONUS HINT ===
The flag format is PHXCTF{...}
Look for this pattern in your decoded results!

Good luck, cipher master!
